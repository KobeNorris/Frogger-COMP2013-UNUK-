In this video, I will discribe 2 main features I've developed based on the original code
First feature is new game elements
I've remade the crocodile in river, whose month is only lethal when it is open
A snake wandering on the middle lane is relised as well
All stage information is demonstrated in the head bar, including present score and high score
Extra types of End is remade, and their position might change ramdomly every 6 seconds
Player's life number and remaining time is demonstrated in the rear of the window
And a time bar is created to improve user experience
Player could press space key to pause and restart the game
In an infinite mode, each time all ends have been reached, 
the game will be reset automatically and its difficulty will increase
All game elements will be accelerated according to a curve grow algorithm
And player's present score will be preserved
